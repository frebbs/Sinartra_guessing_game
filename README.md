# WebGuesser in Rails

### First go at the Sinatra web framework 

First attempt at creating a web server with rails, it's a simple guessing game where you are 
required to guess the random number generated on the initial page load.

You will get a hint when you are within + / - 10 of the random number generated this round.

Once you have guessed the number, a new random number will be generated and your win count will increase by one.

The game is currently infinite in length, ie no ultimate win condition so this will continue forever.

#### Files

I have created a helpers folder where some of the game logic has been taken out of the main Ruby file, there
is also a public/css folder that contains my elegant css styling skills! (Not fake news!)

The views folder contains erb files that rendered to the client.


#### Updates

Maybe? As I learn more, I may find it hard to look at the code without feeling embarrassment im sure, so I will probably refactor
and add more things as I learn, the transition will be within the commit history, perhaps........ ;)
